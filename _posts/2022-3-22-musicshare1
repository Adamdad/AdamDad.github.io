1. 风神123-交工乐队
This Hakka song discribes what the traveler saw and felt after returning to his home village. On the one hand, it conveys the sadness of peoples who are abandaned by harshness of city life.
At the same time, the mother's comfort to her son in the song is full of a simple but incomparably strong hope for life: No matter what, you have to live on.
