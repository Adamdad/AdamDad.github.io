I am an incoming Ph.d student at [National University of Singapore(NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) at ECE department. I am now working under the supervision of [Prof.Xinchao Wang](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/wang-xinchao/). I got my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in 2021 and my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/), China in 2019. I am also fortunate to work with [Prof.Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/), [Prof.Rose Yu](http://roseyu.com/), [Prof.Fenglong ma](http://personal.psu.edu/ffm5105/) and [Prof.Yining Hu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yining-Hu-4). I used to be a visiting student at University of Ottawa, supervised by [Prof.Robert Laganière](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~laganier/). 

My current research interest can be summarized into **3M** scheme:
- Statistical **M**achine learning. Focus on generative modeling, trust-worthy learning (interpretability and robustness) and graph learning.
- **M**inimal supervision. Focus on self-supervised & semi-supervised & weak-supervised learning, transfer learning, knowledge-grounded learning.
- **M**edical data analysis, especially during the outbreak of the pandemic.
