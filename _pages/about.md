 I am a first-year Ph.D student at [National University of Singapore(NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) at Learning and Vision Lab. I am now working under the supervision of [Prof.Xinchao Wang](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/wang-xinchao/). 

My current research interest can be summarized into **3M** scheme:
- Statistical **M**achine learning. Focus on generative modeling, trust-worthy learning (interpretability and robustness) and graph learning, with theoretical basis or guarantee.
- **M**inimal supervision. Focus on self-supervised & semi-supervised & weak-supervised learning, transfer learning, knowledge-grounded learning.
- **M**edical data analysis, especially during the outbreak of the pandemic.
