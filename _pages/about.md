I am a second year master student of University of California, San Diego. I am now working under the supervision of [Prof.Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/). I am also fortunate to work with [Prof.Rose Yu](http://roseyu.com/) and [Prof.Fenglong ma](http://personal.psu.edu/ffm5105/). I got my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/), China in 2019. I used to be a visiting student at University of Ottawa, supervised by [Prof.Robert Laganière](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~laganier/).

My current research interest can be summarized into **3M** scheme:
- Statistical **M**achine learning. Focus on generative modeling and robust learning.
- **M**inimal supervision. Focus on self-supervised & weak-supervised learning, transfer learning, knowledge-grounded learning.
- **M**edical data analysis, especially in the outbreak of the pandemic.
