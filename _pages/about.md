I am a first year master student of University of California, San Diego. I am now working closely with [Prof.Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/). I got my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/), China in 2019. I used to be a visiting student of University of Ottawa, supervised by [Prof.Robert Lagani√®re](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~laganier/). 

My research interest includes deep neural network and its application on computer vision and natural language processing. Recently I am paying special attention to adversarial learning.
