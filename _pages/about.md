I am a second year master student of University of California, San Diego. I am now working under the supervision of [Prof.Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/). I got my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/), China in 2019. I am fortunate to work with [Prof.Rose Yu](http://roseyu.com/) and [Prof.Fenglong ma](http://personal.psu.edu/ffm5105/). I used to be a visiting student at University of Ottawa, supervised by [Prof.Robert Lagani√®re](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~laganier/).

My research interest includes deep neural network and its application on healthcare data, especially in the outbreak of the pandemic. Recently I am paying special attention on label-efficient learning(e.g. self-supervised & weak-supervised learning, meta-learning) and deep generative learning.
