 I am a first-year Ph.D student at [National University of Singapore(NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) at [Learning and Vision Lab](http://www.lv-nus.org). I am now working under the supervision of [Prof.Xinchao Wang](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/wang-xinchao/). 

My current research interest lies in Efficent AI and Statitical ML:
- Knowledge Efficiency, that empowers the AI systems to learn new tasks with the knowledge from trained models and human experts.
- Data Efficency. Focus on self-supervised & semi-supervised & weak-supervised learning or learning with synthesized data.
- Statitical ML. Focus on statitical modelling, trust-worthy learning (interpretability and robustness) and graph learning, ideally, with theoretical basis or guarantee.

I believe in [Slow Science](http://slow-science.org/)
